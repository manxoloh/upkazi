		 <p>Upkazi provides this Privacy Policy to let you know our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information through www.upkazi.com, and any other websites, features, applications, widgets or online services that are owned or controlled by Upkazi and that post a link to this Privacy Policy (together with the Site, the Service), as well as any information Upkazi collects offline in connection with the Service. It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your personal information.</p>
		 <p>Note that we combine the information we collect from you from the Site, through the Service generally, or offline. By accessing or using the Service, you consent to the information collection, disclosure and use practices described in this Privacy Policy. Please note that certain features or services referenced in this Privacy Policy may not be offered on the Service at all times.</p>
		
		 <h1><b>1. INFORMATION COLLECTION</b></h1>
		 <p>Users of the Service may be Clients (anyone utilizing the Upkazi platform to request services to be performed by a Freelancer) or Freelancers (any company, individual user, or groups of associated individual users or companies utilizing the Upkazi platform to offer services to Clients). Freelancers may also operate as an Agency (a legally recognized entity with the ability to hire and/or contract) with other Freelancers.</p>
		
		 <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
		 <p><b>Personal Information:</b>In the course of using the Service (whether as a Client or Freelancer), we may require or otherwise collect information that identifies you as a specific individual and can be used to contact or identify you (Personal Information). Examples of Personal Information include your name, email address, company address, billing address, and phone number.</p>
		<p><b>Payment Information:</b> If you use the Service to make or receive payments, we will also collect certain payment information, such as credit card, PayPal or other financial account information, and billing address.</p>
		<p><b>Identity Verification:</b> We may collect Personal Information, such as your date of birth or taxpayer identification number, to validate your identity or as may be required by law, such as to complete tax filings. We may request documents to verify this information, such as a copy of your government-issued identification or photo or a billing statement.</p>
		<p><b>General Audience Service:</b> The Service is general audience and intended for users 18 and older. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone younger than age 18. If we become aware that a child younger than 18 has provided us with Personal Information, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our files. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child younger than age 18 and believe that Upkazi has collected Personal Information from your child, please contact us.</p>
		<p><b>Non-Identifying Information/Usernames:</b>We also may collect other information, such as zip codes, demographic data, information regarding your use of the Service, and general project-related data Non-Identifying Information). We may aggregate information collected from Upkazi registered and non-registered users. We consider usernames to be
Non-Identifying Information. Usernames are made public through the Service and are viewable by other Upkazi Users. </p>
                <p><b>Combination of Personal and Non-Identifying Information:</b>Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers in a way that enables you to be identified (for example, combining information with your name). But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information, but Upkazi will treat the combined information as Personal Information.</p>
		<h1><b>2. USE AND RETENTION OF INFORMATION</b><h1>
		<p>WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT:</p>
		<p>To provide and improve the Service, complete your transactions, and address your inquiries, process your registration, verify the information you provide is valid and for compliance and internal business purposes;</p>
		<p>To contact you with administrative communications and Upkazi newsletters, marketing or promotional materials (on behalf of Upkazi or third parties) and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the instructions in the Your Choices and Opting Out section, below;</p>
		<p>To tailor content we display to you and offers we may present to you, both on the Service and elsewhere online</p>
		<p>To administer and develop our business relationship with you and, if applicable, the corporation or other legal entity you represent;</p>	
		<p>To enforce and comply with the law, including to conduct an investigation, to protect the property and rights of Upkazi or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, fraudulent, unethical or legally actionable activity. We may also use Device Identifiers to identify Upkazi Users;</p>
		<p>For the purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information, with your consent, and as further described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		
		<h1><b>3. INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</b><h1>
		<p>
    <b>Information about Freelancers Shared with Clients and Agencies:</b> We share information regarding Freelancers working on a Client project, including information in Work Diaries and work history, with Clients. Note that if a Freelancer is suspended from the Upkazi Service, we may share that information with Clients for whom that Freelancer has worked or applied for work. We may also share information with Agencies to whom Freelancers are associated for a particular work project. If you choose to apply for work as a Freelancer via the Service, we will share information relevant to your application with the applicable Client(s), including, but not limited to, the information contained in your Freelancer Profile.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Information about Clients and Agencies Shared with Freelancers:</b> If you have entered into a service contract with another user, we may provide him/her with your name, company address, billing address, or tax ID or VAT number in order to complete the transaction or to facilitate the resolution of a claim or dispute. The user receiving your information is not allowed to use it for purposes unrelated to the transaction, such as to contact you for marketing purposes, unless you have expressly consented to it.
</p>		
<p><b>Service Providers:</b> We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and online advertising, payment processing, fraud detection and improvement of Upkazi features or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used. These third parties may have access to your Personal Information in order to perform these tasks on our behalf.</p>
 <h1><b>4. SECURITY</b></h1>
<p>Upkazi takes commercially reasonable steps to help protect and secure the information it collects and stores about Upkazi Users. All access to the Site is encrypted using industry-standard transport layer security technology (TLS). When you enter sensitive information (such as tax identification number), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also use HTTP strict transport security to add an additional layer of protection for our Upkazi Users. But remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Thus, while we strive to protect your personal data, Upkazi cannot ensure and does not warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.<p>
<h1><b>5. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</b></h1>
		 <p>Upkazi may update this Privacy Policy at any time and any changes will be effective upon posting. In the event that there are material changes to the way we treat your Personal Information, we will display a notice through the Services prior to the change becoming effective. We may also notify you by email, in our discretion. However, we will use your Personal Information in a manner consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time you submitted the information, unless you consent to the new or revised policy.</p>

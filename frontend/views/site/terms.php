You acknowledge and agree that feedback results for you, including your Job Success Score (“JSS”), if any, will consist of comments, ratings, indicators of User satisfaction, and other feedback left by other Users.  You further acknowledge and agree that Upkazi will make feedback results available to other marketplace Users, including composite or compiled feedback.  Upkazi provides this feedback system as a means through which Users can share their opinions publicly and Upkazi does not monitor or censor these opinions.

You agree not to use the JSS to make any employment, credit, credit valuation, underwriting, or other similar decision about any other User.</p>
    <p>Upkazi does not investigate any remarks posted by Users for accuracy or reliability but may do so if a User requests that Upkazi do so.  You may be held legally responsible for damages suffered by other Users or third parties as a result of your remarks if such remarks are legally actionable or defamatory.  Upkazi is not legally responsible for any feedback or comments posted or made available on the Site by any Users or third parties, even if that information is defamatory or otherwise legally actionable.  In order to protect the integrity of the feedback system and protect Users from abuse, Upkazi reserves the right (but is under no obligation) to remove posted feedback or information that, in Upkazi’s sole judgment, violates the Terms of Service or negatively affects our marketplace.  You acknowledge and agree that you will notify Upkazi of any error or inaccurate statement in your feedback results, including the JSS, and that if you do not do so, Upkazi may rely on the accuracy of such information.</p>
